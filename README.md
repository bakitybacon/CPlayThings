Me playing around with the C Programming Language as demos for people starting with C.

How to compile
--------------

Just do a simple

    gcc $filename.c -o $filename.app
    
or

    cc $filename.c -o $filename.app

then use

    ./filename.app

to execute if in linux.

Compiling in window is most easily done with an IDE such as [DevC++](http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) which can be used to compile and run just by hitting the compile and run button with the file you want to compile open in the editor.
